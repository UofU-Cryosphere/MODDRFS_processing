# MODDRFS_processing
This repository contains a Jupyter notebook that outlines a step-by-step processing procedure for raw MODDRFS geotiff files so that mixed pixel effects are minimized. The end product contains daily dust radiative forcing (RF) data masked to snow persistence at high snow cover fraction (fSCA). This code was developed for application in the Great Salt Lake Basin but can be adapted to other basins/regions by defining regional snow cover fraction and snow persistence thresholds based on knowledge of local terrain and snow distribution patterns.
