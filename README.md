# MODDRFS_processing
This repository contains: 
1) A folder "matlab_to_geotiff" outlining the conversion of MODIS Matlab files to GeoTIFF files. Open the folder for additional information. Authors: Joachim Meyer, Patrick Naple 
2) A Jupyter notebook "MODDRFS_workflow_notebook.ipynb" that outlines a step-by-step processing of MODDRFS GeoTIFF files. This notebook clips GeoTIFFS to a desired region, reprojects them to a desired coordinate system, and employs masking procedures using MODSCAG data to minimize mixed pixel effects. The end product contains daily dust radiative forcing (RF) data masked to snow persistence at high snow cover fraction (fSCA). This code was developed for application in the Great Salt Lake Basin but can be adapted to other basins/regions by defining regional snow cover fraction and snow persistence thresholds based on knowledge of local terrain and snow distribution patterns. Authors: Otto Lang, Patrick Naple, Dillon Ragar.
